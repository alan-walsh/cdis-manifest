# Core Gen3 Release 2022.06

## uc-cdis/fence

#### Improvements
  - InCommon: do not configure duplicate Shibboleth IDPs (#1024)
  - Fix generic OIDC: `get_user_id` returns the correct user ID field (#1021)

## uc-cdis/cdis-data-client

#### New Features
  - add GitHub Action for Golang CI (#108)

## uc-cdis/guppy

## uc-cdis/hatchery

#### Improvements
  - using the new github action instead of the reusable workflow (#48)

#### New Features
  - Reusable workflow for Go tests with coverage (#46)

## uc-cdis/indexd

#### New Features
  - Adding listen queue to uwsgi config. We were seeing issues with large 
    instances of indexd (100M) on a large amount of `GET` requests we had a 
    1.5% failure rate. Adding a listen queue solved this. (#332)

## uc-cdis/pelican

#### Bug Fixes
  - don't attempt to query if id_chunks is False-y for whatever reason (as this 
    causes an exception) (#64)

#### New Features
  - Make portal works with customized `BASENAME`, in both production mode and 
    dev mode (#990)
  - tabbed metadata detail display (#983)

#### Improvements

    page hot-reload (#990)

#### Deployment Changes

    (#983)

#### Bug Fixes

    with proper concatenation (#988)

  - (*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. 
    (#368)
  - Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find 
    them when the project is tested again. This may be because the 
    vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all 
    of the effected dependencies could be upgraded. (#368)
  - Check the changes in this PR to ensure they won't cause issues with your 
    project. (#368)
  - Note:** *You are seeing this because you or someone else with access to 
    this repository has authorized Snyk to open fix PRs. (#368)

    from. (#176)
